# Commit Message Skill

Analyze the current staged changes (or all uncommitted changes if nothing is staged) and print a conventional commit message to the terminal.

## Rules:
- Do NOT run any git commit commands
- Just print the suggested commit message
- Use conventional commits format (feat:, fix:, refactor:, docs:, etc.)
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters
- Add a body only if the change is complex
